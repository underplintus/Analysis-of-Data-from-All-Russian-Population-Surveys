<h2 style="color:#ff6347;">1Ô∏è‚É£ Demographic Analysis:</h2> 
    
**The conducted analysis of demographic data revealed the following important points:**

- The most numerous groups of respondents are from the following cities: Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Republic of Dagestan, Stavropol Krai, and Rostov Oblast. This indicates a wide geographic coverage and diversity of the represented regions.
- Age analysis showed that respondents from Stavropol Krai are the oldest, with a median age of 50 years for women and 47 years for men. This may indicate more stable and mature age groups in this region.
- More women participated in the survey than men. This may be due to their greater willingness to participate in such studies, as well as higher social activity.
- It is noted that 38.4% of respondents have secondary vocational education, which is the most common level of education among respondents. At the same time, only 2 people in the sample completed postgraduate studies.

The demographic analysis allowed us to better understand the characteristics of the surveyed audience. We found that participants from various regions of Russia took part in the study, indicating its wide coverage. It also turned out that the majority of respondents have secondary vocational education, but only a few completed postgraduate studies.

The oldest respondents are from Stavropol Krai, which may indicate the specifics of this region. Moreover, the larger number of women in the survey may indicate higher activity in such studies.

These results allow us to conclude that the study provided insight into the diversity and geographic distribution of respondents, their education level, and age characteristics. This information can be useful for further analysis and development of recommendations.
